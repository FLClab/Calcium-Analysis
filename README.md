# Calcium Analysis

This is the official repository for the paper **Quantitative Analysis of Miniature Synaptic Calcium Transients Using Positive Unlabeled Deep Learning**  

Open in [Colab]()


# System Requirements

## Hardware Requirements
Training and inference of the deep learning models require a GPU for reasonable run time. 

## Software Requirements
### OS requirements 
The source code was tested on Linux - CentOS 7
